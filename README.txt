Quokka — instant feedback tool
------------------------------
Use Quokka to get instant responses without a separate run process.

To run Quokka
   1. Make sure the Quokka plugin is installed in VS Code.
   2. Navigate to the file that you want to run.
   3. Press Ctrl+K, then release, and press Q.
   4. The output should appear automatically in the editor.

Folder structure
----------------
Folders are arranged in two parts:

1. completed/
   - Contains both questions and correct solutions.
2. blank/
   - Contains only questions, intended for you to fill in your answers when practicing.

Notes & tips
-----------
- Use basic JavaScript techniques, not any extension plugins such as _underscore.JavaScript
- Folders are arranged in groups based on the category of questions being asked
- Multiple solutions are possible, typically only one solution is displayed in the completed folder
